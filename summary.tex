Nitrogen conversion reactions play a critical role in environmental remediation and sustainable chemical production. Metal oxide surfaces offer promising catalytic platforms for these transformations, yet understanding their stability and activity under reactive conditions remains a challenge. This work presents a computational framework combining density functional theory, machine learning potentials, and electrochemical modeling to analyze and screen metal oxide catalysts. By probing adsorption energetics, bulk and surface stability, we identify key descriptors and design principles that guide the development of efficient catalyst design for nitrogen conversion processes.
