We analyse examples of nitrogen use and propose targets, by geographic region and crop type, to meet the 2050 global food demand projected by the Food and Agriculture Organization while also meeting the Sustainable Development Goals pertaining to agriculture recently adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. Furthermore, we discuss socio-economic policies and technological innovations that may help achieve them.},

We examine the catalyst requirements for a new low-pressure, low-temperature synthesis process. We show that the absence of such a process for conventional transition metal catalysts can be understood as a consequence of a scaling relation between the activation energy for N2 dissociation and N adsorption energy found at the surface of these materials. A better catalyst cannot obey this scaling relation. We define the ideal scaling relation characterizing the most active catalyst possible, and show that it is theoretically possible to have a low pressure, low-temperature Haber–Bosch process. The challenge is to find new classes of catalyst materials with properties approaching the ideal, and we discuss the possibility that transition metal compounds have such properties.}

abstract = {Summary
Using solar energy to convert triple bonded molecular dinitrogen from the air into fixed nitrogen products that act as nutrients for plants presents an opportunity to develop “solar fertilizers.” The approach has much in common with solar fuels and chemicals but also has some unique advantages and challenges. The possibility of producing nitrogen fertilizers at a country’s regional level may be able to effectively compete with existing technology by reducing the per unit cost of N nutrient production, removing or reducing transportation costs within or across international borders, and integrating with existing infrastructure. Furthermore, solar fertilizer technologies can reduce the energy and carbon footprint currently associated with the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis. Deploying solar fertilizer technology in developing countries can also improve access to fertilizers for farmers in remote regions and help achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2 of ending hunger and ensuring access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food for all people, in particular the poor. However, there are also substantial challenges that must be overcome in identifying active catalytic materials and effectively integrating solar fertilizer processes with agricultural infrastructure. This paper outlines the agronomic considerations that drive the development of decentralized solar fertilizer production and explores their implications on fertilizer prices with an emphasis on the developing world. The work also provides an overview of the technical strategies that may enable photo(electro)chemical fertilizer production processes, including the use of fertigation or production of enhanced biochar, and identifies some target metrics and testing considerations to promote efficient development of new fertilizer materials and processes.}

abstract = {Utilisation of nitrogen (N) has been closely related to increases in crop productivity. However, not all crops respond similarly and the objective of this study is to identify physiological processes that determine responses to N supply for maize and sunflower. Grain yield in maize (range: 210–1255gm−2) was greater and more responsive to N supply than in sunflower (106–555gm−2 in carbohydrate equivalents) over a wide range of total N uptake (3–>20gNm−2). In maize, differences in grain yield among levels of N supply were associated more with variation in biomass than in harvest index. In sunflower, differences in grain yield (in carbohydrate equivalents) among levels of N supply were related similarly to variation in both biomass and harvest index. The decrease in biomass production with decreasing N supply was associated with decreases in both radiation interception and radiation use efficiency (RUE). Decreased interception was due to effects of N supply on reducing canopy leaf area, whereas the reduced RUE was associated with decreased SLN. Total biomass production in maize was more responsive to N supply than in sunflower. The major determinants of the differences in response of biomass accumulation to N supply found between maize and sunflower are: (i) sunflower tends to maintain SLN with increase in partitioning of N to leaves under N limitation whereas maize tends to maintain leaf area with increase in partitioning of biomass to leaves and (ii) the ability of maize to maintain N uptake following cessation of leaf production.}

Specifically, employing a local formulation of the electrostatics, the Chebyshev polynomial filtered self-consistent field iteration, and a reformulation of the non-local force component, we develop a finite-difference framework wherein both the energy and atomic forces can be efficiently calculated to within desired accuracies in DFT. We demonstrate using a wide variety of materials systems that SPARC achieves high convergence rates in energy and forces with respect to spatial discretization to reference plane-wave result; exponential convergence in energies and forces with respect to vacuum size for slabs and wires; energies and forces that are consistent and display negligible ‘egg-box’ effect; accurate properties of crystals, slabs, and wires; and negligible drift in molecular dynamics simulations. We also demonstrate that the weak and strong scaling behavior of SPARC is similar to well-established and optimized plane-wave implementations for systems consisting up to thousands of electrons, but with a significantly reduced prefactor. Overall, SPARC represents an attractive alternative to plane-wave codes for performing DFT simulations of extended systems.

Rate parameters for the key gas-phase reactions of the nitrogen species are surveyed, based on available information from experiments and high-level theory. The mechanisms for thermal and prompt-NO, for fuel-NO, and NO formation via NNH or N2O are discussed, along with the chemistry of NO removal processes such as reburning and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction of NO. Each subset of the mechanism is evaluated against experimental data and the accuracy of modeling predictions is discussed.}

abstract={The industrial Haber--Bosch process to produce ammonia (NH3) from dinitrogen (N2) is crucial for modern society. However, N2 activation is inherently challenging and the Haber--Bosch process has significant drawbacks, as it is highly energy intensive, is not sustainable owing to substantial CO2 emissions primarily from the generation of H2 and requires large, centralized facilities. New strategies of sustainable N2 activation, such as low-temperature thermochemical catalysis and (photo)electrocatalysis, have been pursued, but progress has been hindered by the lack of rigour and reproducibility in the collection and analysis of results. In this Primer, we provide a holistic step by step protocol, applicable to all nitrogen-transformation reactions, focused on verifying genuine N2 activation by accounting for all contamination sources. We compare state-of-the-art results from different catalytic reactions following the protocol's framework, and discuss necessary reporting metrics and ways to interpret both experimental and density functional theory results. This Primer covers various common pitfalls in the field, best practices to improve reproducibility and cost-efficient methods to carry out rigorous experimentation. The future of nitrogen catalysis will require an increase in rigorous experimentation and standardization to prevent false positives from appearing in the literature, which can enable advancing towards practical technologies for the activation of N2.},

abstract = {We briefly outline the Charge Optimized Many Body (COMB) potential formalism, which enables the molecular dynamics simulation of complex materials structures in which multiple types of bonding (metallic, covalent, ionic and secondary bonding) coexist. We illustrate its capabilities to address critical issues in the area of nuclear fuel. In particular, we look at U, UO2 and the process of oxidation of U. Further, we characterize the mechanical behavior of Zr, representing LWR clad, and explore the effects of oxidation and hydridation on the mechanical response and briefly illustrate the capabilities of COMB simulations of corrosion. Finally, we briefly assess the materials fidelity of the COMB approach by examining the COMB description for the Zr-H system.}

abstract={Computational de novo design of new drugs and materials requires rigorous and unbiased exploration of chemical compound space. However, large uncharted territories persist due to its size scaling combinatorially with molecular size. We report computed geometric, energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties for 134k stable small organic molecules made up of CHONF. These molecules correspond to the subset of all 133,885 species with up to nine heavy atoms (CONF) out of the GDB-17 chemical universe of 166 billion organic molecules. We report geometries minimal in energy, corresponding harmonic frequencies, dipole moments, polarizabilities, along with energies, enthalpies, and free energies of atomization. All properties were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of quantum chemistry. Furthermore, for the predominant stoichiometry, C7H10O2, there are 6,095 constitutional isomers among the 134k molecules. We report energies, enthalpies, and free energies of atomization at the more accurate G4MP2 level of theory for all of them. As such, this data set provides quantum chemical properties for a relevant, consistent, and comprehensive chemical space of small organic molecules. This database may serve the benchmarking of existing methods, development of new methods, such as hybrid quantum mechanics/machine learning, and systematic identification of structure-property relationships.},

abstract = {Deep learning has the potential to revolutionize quantum chemistry as it is ideally suited to learn representations for structured data and speed up the exploration of chemical space. While convolutional neural networks have proven to be the first choice for images, audio and video data, the atoms in molecules are not restricted to a grid. Instead, their precise locations contain essential physical information, that would get lost if discretized. Thus, we propose to use continuous-filter convolutional layers to be able to model local correlations without requiring the data to lie on a grid. We apply those layers in SchNet: a novel deep learning architecture modeling quantum interactions in molecules. We obtain a joint model for the total energy and interatomic forces that follows fundamental quantum-chemical principles. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance for benchmarks of equilibrium molecules and molecular dynamics trajectories. Finally, we introduce a more challenging benchmark with chemical and structural variations that suggests the path for further work.},

abstract={In the past two and a half decades machine learning potentials have evolved from a special purpose solution to a broadly applicable tool for large-scale atomistic simulations. By combining the efficiency of empirical potentials and force fields with an accuracy close to first-principles calculations they now enable computer simulations of a wide range of molecules and materials. In this perspective, we summarize the present status of these new types of models for extended systems, which are increasingly used for materials modelling. There are several approaches, but they all have in common that they exploit the locality of atomic properties in some form. Long-range interactions, most prominently electrostatic interactions, can also be included even for systems in which non-local charge transfer leads to an electronic structure that depends globally on all atomic positions. Remaining challenges and limitations of current approaches are discussed.},

abstract={The electrochemical reduction of CO2 and H2 evolution from water can be used to store renewable energy that is produced intermittently. Scale-up of these reactions requires the discovery of effective electrocatalysts, but the electrocatalyst search space is too large to explore exhaustively. Here we present a theoretical, fully automated screening method that uses a combination of machine learning and optimization to guide density functional theory calculations, which are then used to predict electrocatalyst performance. We demonstrate the feasibility of this method by screening various alloys of 31 different elements, and thereby perform a screening that encompasses 50{\%} of the d-block elements and 33{\%} of the p-block elements. This method has thus far identified 131 candidate surfaces across 54 alloys for CO2 reduction and 258 surfaces across 102 alloys for H2 evolution. We use qualitative analyses to prioritize the top candidates for experimental validation.},

abstract={Machine learning, trained on quantum mechanics (QM) calculations, is a powerful tool for modeling potential energy surfaces. A critical factor is the quality and diversity of the training dataset. Here we present a highly automated approach to dataset construction and demonstrate the method by building a potential for elemental aluminum (ANI-Al). In our active learning scheme, the ML potential under development is used to drive non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with time-varying applied temperatures. Whenever a configuration is reached for which the ML uncertainty is large, new QM data is collected. The ML model is periodically retrained on all available QM data. The final ANI-Al potential makes very accurate predictions of radial distribution function in melt, liquid-solid coexistence curve, and crystal properties such as defect energies and barriers. We perform a 1.3M atom shock simulation and show that ANI-Al force predictions shine in their agreement with new reference DFT calculations.},

abstract={A key challenge to realizing practical electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is the decrease in the NRR activity before reaching the mass-transfer limit as overpotential increases. While the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been suggested to be responsible for this phenomenon, the mechanistic origin has not been clearly explained. Herein, we investigate the potential-dependent competition between NRR and HER using the constant electrode potential model and microkinetic modeling. We find that the H coverage and N2 coverage crossover leads to the premature decrease of NRR activity. The coverage crossover originates from the larger charge transfer in H+ adsorption than N2 adsorption. The larger charge transfer in H+ adsorption, which potentially leads to the coverage crossover, is a general phenomenon seen in various heterogeneous catalysts, posing a fundamental challenge to realize practical electrochemical NRR. We suggest several strategies to overcome the challenge based on the present understandings.},

abstract = {We describe an experimental method to probe the adsorption of water at the surface of isolated, substrate-free TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) based on soft X-ray spectroscopy in the gas phase using synchrotron radiation. To understand the interfacial properties between water and TiO2 surface, a water shell was adsorbed at the surface of TiO2 NPs. We used two different ways to control the hydration level of the NPs: in the first scheme, initially solvated NPs were dried and in the second one, dry NPs generated thanks to a commercial aerosol generator were exposed to water vapor. XPS was used to identify the signature of the water layer shell on the surface of the free TiO2 NPs and made it possible to follow the evolution of their hydration state. The results obtained allow the establishment of a qualitative determination of isolated NPs' surface states, as well as to unravel water adsorption mechanisms. This method appears to be a unique approach to investigate the interface between an isolated nano-object and a solvent over-layer, paving the way towards new investigation methods in heterogeneous catalysis on nanomaterials.},

abstract = {The dependence of the surface properties of thin rutile TiO2 (110) films on the number of layers in two- dimensional slab models has been investigated with first-principles methods based on density-functional theory. A pronounced oscillation of the interlayer distances, surface and adhesion energies, and electronic structure as a function of the number of layers has been found. The effect can be explained by surface-induced hybridization of Ti 3d and O 2p orbitals among the layers. This leads to reinforced interactions between the first and second layers and to weaker bonding and longer distances between the second and third layers of the films. By removing the 3d orbitals from the Ti basis set we found that TiO2 behaves almost exactly as the isostructural SnO2 (110) surface. The results are of importance for the properties of epitaxial ultrathin films grown on metal substrates as well as for single crystal surfaces.},

abstract = {We have used density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the adsorption and first dissociation step of ammonia on both clean and Pt-covered TiO2 rutile (110) surfaces. On clean rutile TiO2 (110) surface, NH3 and NH2 prefer to chemisorb on the five-coordinated titanium (Ti5c) site, and H is adsorbed favorably on the bridging oxygen (O1) site, while a single Pt atom prefers to adsorb on the hollow (H2) site. It is found that the preadsorbed Pt atom enhances significantly the adsorption of NH3, NH2 and H species on rutile TiO2 (110) surface by binding with Pt adatom directly. It is also found that the first dissociation step of ammonia (NH3???NH2+H) on the clean rutile TiO2 (110) surface is endothermic by 0.89eV, and no transition state exists. In addition, the first dissociation step of ammonia on Pt-covered rutile TiO2 (110) surface is found to be endothermic by only 0.43eV, but presents an activation energy barrier of 1.82eV. A comparison of the adsorption and first dissociation step of ammonia on rutile TiO2 (110) surface with and without Pt adatom has been discussed. Investigations indicate that the adsorbed Pt adatom on clean rutile TiO2 (110) surface not only changes the surface electron structure, but also varies the reaction pathways by participating in the reaction. It is expected that our results would provide useful information for the development of catalyst for NH3 dissociation. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Developing an accurate simulation method for the electrochemical stability of solids, as well as understanding the physics related with its accuracy, is critically important for improving the performance of compounds and predicting the stability of new materials in aqueous environments. Herein we propose a workflow for the accurate calculation of first-principles electrochemical phase (Pourbaix) diagrams. With this scheme, we study the electrochemical stabilities of Ti and Ti oxides using density-functional theory. First, we find the accuracy of an exchange-correlation functional in predicting formation energies and electrochemical stabilities is closely related with the electronic exchange interaction therein. Second, the metaGGA and hybrid functionals with a more precise description of the electronic exchange interaction lead to a systematic improvement in the accuracy of the Pourbaix diagrams. Furthermore, we show that accurate Ti Pourbaix diagrams also require that thermal effects are included through vibrational contributions to the free energy. We then use these diagrams to explain various experimental electrochemical phenomena for the Ti--O system, and show that if experimental formation energies for Ti oxides, which contain contributions from defects owing to their generation at high (combustion) temperatures, are directly used to predict room temperature Pourbaix diagrams then significant inaccuracies result. In contrast, the formation energies from accurate first-principles calculations, e.g., using metaGGA and hybrid functionals, are found to be more reliable. Finally to facilitate the future application of our accurate electrochemical phase equilibria diagrams, the variation of the Ti Pourbaix diagrams with aqueous ion concentration is also provided.},

abstract = {The initial step of O-2 evolution reaction on a TiO2 surface is a long-standing puzzle. A recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiment showed that the H2O molecule adsorbed on rutile TiO2(110) surface could decompose under ultraviolet illumination (Tan, S. J.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2012, 134, 9978). The underlying reaction mechanism is now examined by our GGA+U study, in which the oxidation of the H2O molecule by both free and trapped holes has been carefully investigated. It is found that the transfer of the hole trapped at the bridge oxygen to the molecule is hindered by the mismatch between the energy and spatial symmetry of the trapped hole orbital and the highest occupied molecule orbital of H2O. The entire oxidation reaction has a high energy barrier and is barely exothermic. In contrast, the oxidation of the molecule by the free hole is energetically more favorable. The free hole is transferred to the H2O molecule via the in-plane oxygen atom when the molecule stays in the transient dissociation state. This mechanism may also be applicable to the photooxidation of other R OH type molecules adsorbed on the rutile TiO2(110) surface.},

NO readily reacts on TiO2(110) to form N2O, which desorbs between 50 and 200??K (LT N2O channels), which leaves the TiO2 surface populated with adsorbed oxygen atoms (Oa) as a by-product of N2O formation. In addition, we observe simultaneous desorption peaks of NO and N2O at 270??K (HT1 N2O) and 400??K (HT2 N2O), respectively, both of which are attributed to reaction-limited processes. No N-derived reaction product desorbs from TiO2(110) surface above 500??K or higher, while the surface may be populated with Oa's and oxidized products such as NO2 and NO3. The adsorbate-free TiO2 surface with oxygen vacancies can be regenerated by prolonged annealing at 850??K or higher. Detailed analysis of the three N2O desorption yields reveals that the surface species for the HT channels are likely to be various forms of NO dimers.},

This allows for ab initio calculations providing reference adsorption energetics at solid surfaces with an accuracy approaching 1 kcal/mol. This is an invaluable asset, not least for the assessment of density-functional theory (DFT) as the prevalent approach for large-scale production calculations in energy or catalysis applications.

abstract = {We study the energetics and structure of water absorption on the ideal rutile TiO2 (110) surface using dispersion-corrected periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations and on-site Coulomb potential (DFT+U) corrections. Conventional (PBE) and self-consistent dispersion-corrected DFT methods (vdw-DF1 and vdw-DF2) both suggest that molecular adsorption of intact water molecules on the rutile (110) surface is increasingly preferred with increasing simulation slab thickness. However, empirical dispersion corrections indicate a mix of molecular and dissociated water may coexist at room temperature, with less dependence on slab thickness. This same behavior is seen for DFT+U with U = 3 eV in combination with or without self-consistent dispersion corrected DFT. We find that the preference for the occurrence of dissociated water increases with increasing U. When compared with experimental bond-length data for the adsorbed water species, none of the methods and slab thicknesses correctly predict all bond lengths simultaneously. However, of the methods that energetically favor coexisting associated and dissociated water species on the surface, the three-layer slab with conventional DFT (PBE) and the empirically dispersion-corrected DFT methods come closest to correctly reproducing all of the experimentally observed bond lengths. We conclude that the current level of DFT is insufficient to definitively distinguish between the fully associated and partially dissociated states of water adsorbed on the pristine rutile (110) surface, due to the very small (0.1 eV) total energy differences between these states.},

In addition, the inclusion of spin polarization substantially lowers the energy of all the systems studied, when compared with spin-paired solutions.

The oxygen atoms in the adsorbate molecules are preferentially extracted by the substrate TiO2 surface. The deoxygenation of adsorbates is accompanied by the oxidation of surface Ti3+ sites. The yield of reduction products (D2, 13C2H4, and 15N2O) is therefore proportional to the coverage of surface oxygen vacancies. No deoxygenation reactions are observed on the fully oxidized (defect-free) surface. This unique property of the surface provides a convenient method to quantitatively detect the relative coverage of Ti3+ sites on the TiO2 (110) surface.},

S.; Bredow, T.; Ivashkevich, O. A.; Matulis, V. E. J. Phys. Chem. C. 2012, DOI: 10.1021/jp308393p]. Two complementary theoretical approaches were employed based on plane waves and on the linear combination of Gaussian-type orbitals, respectively. NO adsorption on the rutile(110) surface covered with Agn clusters (n = 2, 4, 8) was studied. For Ag8/rutile(110), two energetically most stable adsorption sites were found: at the border between the silver cluster and the surface and on the silver particles. In the absence of reducing agents, the further stages of NO decomposition are similar to those obtained on Ag/anatase(100). The adsorption of an additional NO molecule results in the formation of an acyclic cis-ONNO dimer. This is followed by the fragmentation of (NO)2 by breaking one or two N-O bonds. The main product of the on-cluster decomposition is molecular nitrogen, while at-border decomposition leads to the formation of N2O. In the on-cluster case, a rather stable dimer structure is formed, which is not directly decomposed. This intermediate can only be decomposed after isomerization to other dimer structures. Similar to the case of Ag/anatase(100), the Ag/rutile(110) surface is oxidized by remaining O atoms after NO decomposition. These O atoms can form NO2 according to an Eley-Rideal mechanism with other NO molecules adsorbed from the gas phase. From the calculated reaction energies, it is concluded that NO conversion on Ag/anatase(100) is more feasible than on Ag/rutile(110).},

The Mo-terminated (0 0 1) surface is then used as a model surface to evaluate the thermochemistry and energetic barriers for key elementary steps in syngas reactions. Adsorption energy scaling relations and Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi relationships are established and used to place Mo 2C into the context of transition metal surfaces. The results indicate that the surface termination is a complex function of reaction conditions and kinetics. It is predicted that the surface will be covered by either C 2H 2 or O depending on conditions. Comparisons with transition metals indicate that the Mo-terminated Mo 2C(0 0 1) surface exhibits carbon reactivity similar to transition metals such as Ru and Ir, but is significantly more reactive toward oxygen. This explains some previous observations for Mo 2C catalysts and suggests that Mo 2C may exhibit unique and potentially useful reactivity or selectivity patterns. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {XPS and periodic DFT calculations have been used to investigate water sorption on the TiO2 rutile (1 1 0) face. Two sets of XPS spectra were collected on the TiO2 (1 1 0) single crystal clean and previously exposed to water: the first set with photoelectrons collected in a direction parallel to the normal to the surface; and the second set with the sample tilted by 70, respectively. This tilting procedure promotes the signals from surface species and reveals that the first hydration layer is strongly coordinated to the surface and also that, despite the fact that the spectra were recorded under ultra-high vacuum, water molecules subsist in upper hydration layers. In addition, periodic DFT calculations were performed to investigate the water adsorption process to determine if molecular and/or dissociative adsorption takes place. The first step of the theoretical part was the optimisation of a dry surface model and then the investigation of water adsorption. The calculated molecular water adsorption energies are consistent with previously published experimental data and it appears that even though it is slightly less stable, the dissociative water sorption can also take place. This assumption was considered, in a second step, on a larger surface model where molecular and dissociated water molecules were adsorbed together with different ratio. It was found that, due to hydrogen bonding stabilisation, molecular and dissociated water molecules can coexist on the surface if the ratio of dissociated water molecules is less than 33{\%}. These results are consistent with previous experimental works giving a 10-25{\%} range. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Adsorption on the TiO2 surface takes place through both the N and O ends of the nitrous oxide molecule. The photochemistry of the adsorbed N2O molecules was studied at 157 K by use of UV irradiation in the range 2.1-5.0 eV. The photoactivity of the adsorbed molecule is dependent on the N2O coverage. At low coverages, the adsorbed N2O is photodepleted to produce adsorbed nitrogen. Larger coverages of N2O are not photodepleted to N2 due to the site blocking in the adsorption process. N-bonded species show a higher photoreactivity than the O-bonded species. Photoformation of NO was not observed at any N2O coverage. },

abstract = {Recently several theoretical studies have examined oxygen adsorption on the clean, reduced TiO2(110) surface. However the photocatalytic behavior of TiO2 and the scavenging ability of oxygen are known to be influenced by the presence of surface hydroxyls. In this paper the chemistry of O2 on the hydroxylated TiO2 surface is investigated by means of first-principles total energy calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. TheMD trajectories show a direct, spontaneous reaction between O2 and the surface hydroxyls, thus supporting the experimental hypothesis that the reaction does not necessarily pass through a chemisorbed O2 state. Following this reaction, the most stable chemisorbed intermediates are found to be peroxide species HO2 and H2O2. Although these intermediates are very stable on the short time scale of MD simulations, the energetics suggests that their further transformation is connected to a new 300 K feature observed in the experimental water temperature programmed desorption (TPD) spectrum. The participation of two less stable intermediate states, involving terminal hydroxyls and/or chemisorbed water plus oxygen adatoms, to the desorption process, is not supported by the total energy calculations. Analysis of the projected density of states, however, suggests the possibility that these intermediates have a role in completing the surface oxidation immediately before desorption. Introduction},

With the aid of (NO)2 dimer adsorption anisotropy, the bidentate configuration of the cis-(NO)2 dimer on fivefold coordinated Ti5c(4+) cation sites was clearly confirmed. The (NO)2 dimer converts to N2O on Ti5c(4+) cation sites at higher NO dosage on both oxidized and reduced surfaces, rather than at Vo sites.

The total energy difference reveals that, with odd number trilayers, the unconstrained slab is much closer to the corresponding constrained slab.

abstract = {Electrochemical potential/pH (Pourbaix) diagrams underpin many aqueous electrochemical processes and are central to the identification of stable phases of metals for processes ranging from electrocatalysis to corrosion. Even though standard DFT calculations are potentially powerful tools for the prediction of such diagrams, inherent errors in the description of transition metal (hydroxy)oxides, together with neglect of van der Waals interactions, have limited the reliability of such predictions for even the simplest pure metal bulk compounds, and corresponding predictions for more complex alloy or surface structures are even more challenging. In the present work, through synergistic use of a Hubbard U correction, a state-of-the-art dispersion correction, and a water-based bulk reference state for the calculations, these errors are systematically corrected. The approach describes the weak binding that occurs between hydroxyl-containing functional groups in certain compounds in Pourbaix diagrams, corrects for self-interaction errors in transition metal compounds, and reduces residual errors on oxygen atoms by preserving a consistent oxidation state between the reference state, water, and the relevant bulk phases. The strong performance is illustrated on a series of bulk transition metal (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) hydroxides, oxyhydroxides, binary, and ternary oxides, where the corresponding thermodynamics of redox and (de)hydration are described with standard errors of 0.04 eV per reaction formula unit. The approach further preserves accurate descriptions of the overall thermodynamics of electrochemically relevant bulk reactions, such as water formation, which is an essential condition for facilitating accurate analysis of reaction energies for electrochemical processes on surfaces. The overall generality and transferability of the scheme suggests that it may find useful application in the construction of a broad array of electrochemical phase diagrams, including both bulk Pourbaix diagrams and surface phase diagrams of interest for corrosion and electrocatalysis},

abstract = {The interaction of water with the (110) crystal face of TiO2 (rutile) was examined with high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD). Water desorption occurred in three sequential TPD features as a function of exposure at 270, 175 and 155 K, ascribed to monolayer, second layer and multilayer states, respectively. Estimation of the extent to which water molecularly versus dissociatively adsorbed on the TiO2(110) surface was attempted by comparing HREELS and TPD data. Very low water exposures (below 7 x 1013molecules/cm2) dissociatively adsorbed at 135 K to surface hydroxyl groups (v(OH) = 3690 cm- 1), but molecular adsorption (v(OH) = 3420 - 3505 cm- 1 and $\delta$(HOH) = 1625 cm- 1) resulted from additional water exposure. The appearance of molecular water in HREELS coincided with a red-shift in the OH stretching frequency of the hydroxyl, presumably due to the formation of hydrogen-bonding interactions with the adsorbed water molecules. Little or no additional water dissociation occurred during heating of the monolayer as inferred from HREELS. Second layer water on TiO2(110) was evident in HREELS by OH stretching intensity below 3400 cm- 1 indicative of hydrogen-bonding. However, the OH stretching mode of monolayer water molecules was not red-shifted by the presence of second layer water suggesting that protons on monolayer water molecules were not involved in hydrogen-bonding second layer water molecules. The influence of second layer water on subsequent layers was evident in both HREELS and TPD.},

abstract = {First-principles calculations based on density-functional theory and the pseudopotential method are used to investigate the energetics of adsorption of the series of molecules H2O, CH3OH, H2O2 and HCO2H on the TiO2(110) surface. The aim of the work is to elucidate the factors that determine whether the adsorption is molecular or dissociative, including the acidity of the molecule, the geometry and electrostatic properties of the surface, and the interaction between adsorbed species. It is shown that the theoretical methods reproduce experimental values of the gas-phase heterolytic and homolytic dissociation energies to reasonable accuracy (within ∼20kJmol−1 for all four molecules). We find that the adsorption energy for the most favourable molecular mode of adsorption is extremely close to that for dissociative adsorption in the cases of H2O, CH3OH and H2O2. For HCO2H, dissociative adsorption is favoured by a substantial margin, provided the dissociated geometry preserves the equivalence of the two oxygens in the formate ion. It is also shown that the geometry of the TiO2(110) surface plays a crucial role in determining the conformations of the most stable geometries, and that hydrogen bonding between adsorbed species is also important.},

abstract = {Today, a major issue about water pollution is the residual dyes from different sources (e.g., textile industries, paper and pulp industries, dye and dye intermediates industries, pharmaceutical industries, tannery and craft bleaching industries, etc.), and a wide variety of persistent organic pollutants have been introduced into our natural water resources or wastewater treatment systems. In fact, it is highly toxic and hazardous to the living organism; thus, the removal of these organic contaminants prior to discharge into the environment is essential. Varieties of techniques have been employed to degrade those organic contaminants and advanced heterogeneous photocatalysis involving zinc oxide (ZnO) photocatalyst appears to be one of the most promising technology. In recent years, ZnO photocatalyst have attracted much attention due to their extraordinary characteristics. The high efficiency of ZnO photocatalyst in heterogeneous photocatalysis reaction requires a suitable architecture that minimizes electron loss during excitation state and maximizes photon absorption. In order to further improve the immigration of photo-induced charge carriers during excitation state, considerable effort has to be exerted to further improve the heterogeneous photocatalysis under UV/visible/solar illumination. Lately, interesting and unique features of metal doping or binary oxide photocatalyst system have gained much attention and became favourite research matter among various groups of scientists. It was noted that the properties of this metal doping or binary oxide photocatalyst system primarily depend on the nature of the preparation method and the role of optimum dopants content incorporated into the ZnO photocatalyst. Therefore, this paper presents a critical review of recent achievements in the modification of ZnO photocatalyst for organic contaminants degradation.}

It captures the quantum mechanical effects governing the complex surface reconstructions of silicon, predicts the stability of different classes of molecules with chemical accuracy, and distinguishes active and inactive protein ligands with more than 99\% reliability. The universality and the systematic nature of our framework provide new insight into the potential energy surface of materials and molecules.}}

In this study{,} we determined that nitrogen vacancies (NVs) could endow graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with the photocatalytic N2 fixation ability. Photocatalytic N2 fixation induced by NVs is free from the interference of other gases. The reason is that NVs could selectively adsorb and activate N2 because NVs have the same shape and size as the nitrogen atom in N2. In addition to this{,} NVs could also improve many other properties of g-C3N4 to support photocatalytic N2 fixation. These new findings could elucidate the design of efficient photocatalysts for photocatalytic N2 fixation."}

X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption, UV–vis spectroscopy, SEM, N2-TPD, EPR, photoluminescence (PL) and photocurrent measurements were used to characterize the prepared catalysts. The results indicate that microwave treatment can form many irregular pores in as-prepared g-C3N4, which causes the increased surface area and separation rate of electrons and holes. More importantly, microwave treatment causes the formation of many nitrogen vacancies in as-prepared g-C3N4. These nitrogen vacancies not only serve as active sites to adsorb and activate N2 molecules but also promote interfacial charge transfer from catalysts to N2 molecules, thus significantly improving the nitrogen photofixation ability. Moreover, the present process is a convenient method for large-scale production of g-C3N4 which is significantly important for the practical application.}

abstract={Heterogeneous catalysts coupled with non-thermal plasmas (NTP) are known to achieve reaction yields that exceed the contributions of the individual components. Rationalization of the enhancing potential of catalysts, however, remains challenging because the background contributions from NTP or catalysts are often non-negligible. Here, we first demonstrate platinum (Pt)-catalyzed nitrogen (N2) oxidation in a radio frequency plasma afterglow at conditions at which neither catalyst nor plasma alone produces significant concentrations of nitric oxide (NO). We then develop reactor models based on reduced NTP- and surface-microkinetic mechanisms to identify the features of each that lead to the synergy between NTP and Pt. At experimental conditions, NTP and thermal catalytic NO production are suppressed by radical reactions and high N2 dissociation barrier, respectively. Pt catalyzes NTP-generated radicals and vibrationally excited molecules to produce NO. The model construction further illustrates that the optimization of productivity and energy efficiency involves tuning of plasma species, catalysts properties, and the reactor configurations to couple plasma and catalysts. These results provide unambiguous evidence of synergism between plasma and catalyst, the origins of that synergy for N2 oxidation, and a modeling approach to guide material selection and system optimization.},

abstract = {TiO2photocatalysis is widely used in a variety of applications and products in the environmental and energy fields, including self-cleaning surfaces, air and water purification systems, sterilization, hydrogen evolution, and photoelectrochemical conversion. The development of new materials, however, is strongly required to provide enhanced performances with respect to the photocatalytic properties and to find new uses for TiO2photocatalysis. In this review, recent developments in the area of TiO2photocatalysis research, in terms of new materials from a structural design perspective, have been summarized. The dimensionality associated with the structure of a TiO2material can affect its properties and functions, including its photocatalytic performance, and also more specifically its surface area, adsorption, reflectance, adhesion, and carrier transportation properties. We provide a brief introduction to the current situation in TiO2photocatalysis, and describe structurally controlled TiO2photocatalysts which can be classified into zero-, one-, two-, and three-dimensional structures. Furthermore, novel applications of TiO2surfaces for the fabrication of wettability patterns and for printing are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We synthesized a chemically modified n-type TiO2 by controlled combustion of Ti metal in a natural gas flame. This material, in which carbon substitutes for some of the lattice oxygen atoms, absorbs light at wavelengths below 535 nanometers and has a lower band-gap energy than rutile (2.32 versus 3.00 electron volts). At an applied potential of 0.3 volt, chemically modified n-type TiO2 performs water splitting with a total conversion efficiency of 11{\%} and a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 8.35{\%} when illuminated at 40 milliwatts per square centimeter. The latter value compares favorably with a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 1{\%} for n-type TiO2 biased at 0.6 volt.},

abstract = {Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely investigated as a photocatalyst material because of its stability and hypotoxicity. However, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2is suppressed by the large band gap and the high recombination rate of the charge carrier, which leads to confined application. Moreover, how to improve photocatalytic H2production without any co-catalyst remains a big challenge. Here, we report a conceptual strategy in a core–shell nanostructure of simultaneously reducing the band gap and the charge carrier recombination rate by introducing a carbon-doped porous TiO2layer onto a metallic TiC nanostructure using a facile in situ thermal growth method. TiC@C-TiO2core–shell nanostructure materials have higher photocatalytic activity in methanol aqueous solution than those of pure P25 and carbon-doped TiO2, which results from enhanced visible light absorption, drastic charge transfer, and the large surface area. Notably, the novel core–shell nanostructures still exhibit excellent photocatalytic H2production without Pt co-catalyst. The results demonstrate that TiC is an ideal support for TiO2photocatalysts, and this novel core–shell nanostructure can significantly shift the position of the band edge of the obtained material. This study presents a design principle for photocatalytic materials as highly efficient visible light photocatalysts.},

abstract = {C-doped and C- and V-doped TiO2photocatalysts were prepared by a sol-gel process. Both catalysts showed high activity for the degradation of acetaldehyde under visible irradiation ({\textgreater} 420  nm). The co-doped TiO2catalysts also were highly active in the dark; 2.0{\%} V-containing co-doped TiO2had the highest activity, comparable with the activity under visible light irradiation. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and N2adsorption-desorption. The results suggest that vanadium ions were introduced both on the surface and into the bulk of TiO2. A free electron, induced by the formation of V5+in the sublayers of TiO2during calcination at 500 °C in air, was delocalized and promoted into the conduction band by thermal energy and further transferred to O2, generating a superoxide radical anion (Oṡ-2) that is responsible for degradation of acetaldehyde in the dark. In addition to functioning as a photosensitizer that shifts the optical response of TiO2from the ultraviolet (UV) to the visible light region, the doped elemental carbon increased the surface area and improved the dispersion of vanadium. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The physicochemical properties of as-synthesized samples were characterized by the X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, BET specific surface area, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Besides, the effects of post solvothermal reaction heating temperature and raw materials on the carbon doping in TiO2have been investigated. The experimental results showed that carbon has been doped into TiO2lattice by replacing the oxygen site with the production of oxygen vacancy. In addition, carbon doped TiO2samples exhibited not only very good destruction ability of NO gas but also excellent degradation ability of methyl orange solution under the visible light much superior to P25 and N-TiO2. The employed method in this work provided a favorable evidence that the effect of carbon doping on the properties of samples should be taken into consideration when preparing TiO2based photocatalyst by a hydrothermal or solvothermal method with the assist of calcination. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, we propose an in situ synthetic strategy for the construct of carbon-doped TiO2single crystal nanorods using CPS/TiO2as the precursors of TiO2nanorods and carbon source via a facile hydrothermal route. This technique involves the preparation of cationic polystyrene spheres (CPS), sequential deposition of TiO2precursor, hydrothermal reaction, and the pyrolysis of CPS in a N2atmosphere at 450°C. The morphology and structure of as-prepared C-TiO2single crystal nanorods were characterized by TEM, SEM, STEM Mapping, XRD, UV–vis spectroscopy, and XPS. All results confirm the carbon doping in the as-prepared TiO2single crystal nanorods. As a result of unique microstructure, the resulting TiO2exhibits remarkably visible-light photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of organic pollutants including methylene blue (MB), Rhodamine B (RhB) and p-nitrophenol (PNP). Therefore, the current study provides a new insight for incorporating dopants into the TiO2single crystals lattice.},

The degradation of methyl orange (MO), as the model reaction, was carried out in the aqueous slurry solution using these photocatalysts at 20 °C. Experimental results reveal that the ratio of TiO2to CB largely affected the performance of composite catalyst. An optimal weight ratio of 1 for the highest photocatalytic capability was found. The photocatalytic performances of TiO2/CB catalysts were also found better than those of TiO2incorporated with activated carbon. The better promoting effect might be attributed to the larger pores of CB which allow a faster diffusion of the adsorbed MO from CB toward TiO2and the high electrical conductivity of CB which can reduce the recombination of electrons and holes generated in TiO2. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Carbon-doped TiO2nanoparticles in a pure anatase phase colored dark brown were successfully prepared using a convenient controlled nonhydrolytic sol-gel method followed by annealing at 400 °C. The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicate that substitutional and interstitial carbon atoms coexist in the lattice of TiO2. The shift of photo response of TiO2from UV to near infrared region is responsible for the multi-type carbon doping by the formation of complex midgap states. The photo-initiated graft polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) is also induced by the carbon impurities in the TiO2structure. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Boehm1984,
abstract = {Carbon catalyses many reactions, mainly oxidation reactions with oxygen and with halogens, e.g. SO2 + 1202 → SO3, or CO + Cl2→ COCl2. It is known, however, that different carbons behave quite differently in the reduction of oxygen on fuel cell cathodes. Therefore the catalytic activity of carbons has been studied in other reactions. A convenient test reaction is the oxidation of dilute aqueous sulphurous acid. It became apparent that all catalytically active carbons contain small quantities of nitrogen, and inactive carbons such as wood charcoal or carbon blacks can be rendered highly active by treatment with N H3 or HCN at elevated temperatures. Photoelectron spectra indicate that the catalytic activity increases parallel to the incorporation of a nitrogen species which is pyridine-like, i.e. incorporated in the aromatic layers. Treatment with NH3 at 900 °C leads also to massive gasification of the carbons, increasing their surface area. Other reactions studied included the oxidation of aqueous oxalic acid and of methanol to formaldehyde. A quite different type of reaction is the elimination of hydrogen chloride from 1-chloroalkanes, e.g. 1 -chlorobutane. Again, activity changes in parallel to nitrogen content. Reaction products are olefins, dimers of the alkyl groups, and a polymer on the catalyst surface. The formation of alkyl dimers, e.g. n-octane in the case of n-butylchloride, suggests that radicals are involved in the reaction.},

@article{Seredych2007,
abstract = {Graphite oxide (GO) was synthesized from commercial graphite and modified by calcinations at 350 °C. The samples were used as adsorbents of ammonia at dry and moist conditions. Their surface before and after exposure to ammonia was characterized using adsorption of nitrogen, XRD, SEM, FTIR, TA, CHN analysis, and potentiometric titration. The results showed that oxidation results in the incorporation of a significant amount of epoxy, phenolic, and carboxylic groups, which is directly manifested by a decrease in surface pH. The majority of the latter is removed by calcinations. During this process, the exfoliation of graphite occurs, resulting in the formation of some micro- and mesporosity. The materials obtained have proven to be excellent adsorbents of ammonia. The NH3 reacts with carboxylic acids and is intercalated between layers or dissolved in pores with adsorbed water. The mechanism depends on the conditions of experiments and surface features of the samples. The highest capacity is obtained on GO on which a significant amount of water is adsorbed, likely on functional groups. This helps in the dissociation of carboxylic groups and their acid−base reactions with ammonia. Nevertheless, a significant amount of ammonia is intercalated between layers. Those two interactions are the strongest. When water is present in the challenge gas, the amount adsorbed decreases because of the competition between water and ammonia for active sites.},

abstract = {A NORIT activated carbon was modified by different chemical and thermal treatments (including oxidation in the gas and liquid phases) in order to obtain materials with different surface properties. Several techniques were used to characterize these materials including nitrogen adsorption, chemical and thermal analyses, XPS, TPD and DRIFTS. The results obtained by TPD agree quantitatively with the elemental and proximate analyses of the oxidized materials, and qualitatively with the observations by DRIFTS. A simple deconvolution method is proposed to analyse the TPD spectra, allowing for the quantitative determination of the amount of each functional group on the surface. A multiple gaussian function has been shown to fit the data adequately, the parameters obtained for each fit matching very well the features observed in the experimentally determined TPD spectra. It is shown that gas phase oxidation of the carbon increases mainly the concentration of hydroxyl and carbonyl surface groups, while oxidations in the liquid phase increase especially the concentration of carboxylic acids.},

Remarkably, HGCNOS exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity than pristine graphitic carbon nitride (GCN). Oxygen doping caused semicrystalline structure, making exciton dissociated at the order-disorder interfaces of HGCNOS and releasing more electrons and holes. Furthermore, the conduction band position of HGCNOS was elevated by sulfur doping, promoting the reduction ability of HGCNOS. Thus, the special electronic and physicochemical structure of HGCNOS contributed to the enhanced photocatalytic activity, facilitating its application on nitrogen photofixation.},

abstract = {Nitrogen fixation is essential for the synthesis of many important chemicals (e.g., fertilizers, explosives) and basic building blocks for all forms of life (e.g., nucleotides for DNA and RNA, amino acids for proteins). However, direct nitrogen fixation is challenging as nitrogen (N₂) does not easily react with other chemicals. By dry ball-milling graphite with N₂, we have discovered a simple, but versatile, scalable and eco-friendly, approach to direct fixation of N₂ at the edges of graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs). The mechanochemical cracking of graphitic C--C bonds generated active carbon species that react directly with N₂ to form five- and six-membered aromatic rings at the broken edges, leading to solution-processable edge-nitrogenated graphene nanoplatelets (NGnPs) with superb catalytic performance in both dye-sensitized solar cells and fuel cells to replace conventional Pt-based catalysts for energy conversion.},

The high mechanical energy accelerated the phase transformation of anatase to rutile, while the existence of the chemical reagents tended to block the transformation. The prepared powders possessed two absorption edges around 400 and 540 nm and showed excellent photocatalytic ability for nitrogen monoxide oxidation under visible light irradiation.

ABSTRACT = {The conversion of molecular nitrogen to ammonia is a key biological and chemical process and represents one of the most challenging topics in chemistry and biology. In Nature the Mo-containing nitrogenase enzymes perform nitrogen ‘fixation’ via an iron molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co) under ambient conditions. In contrast, industrially, the Haber-Bosch process reduces molecular nitrogen and hydrogen to ammonia with a heterogeneous iron catalyst under drastic conditions of temperature and pressure. This process accounts for the production of millions of tons of nitrogen compounds used for agricultural and industrial purposes, but the high temperature and pressure required result in a large energy loss, leading to several economic and environmental issues. During the last 40 years many attempts have been made to synthesize simple homogeneous catalysts that can activate dinitrogen under the same mild conditions of the nitrogenase enzymes. Several compounds, almost all containing transition metals, have been shown to bind and activate N2 to various degrees. However, to date Mo(N2)(HIPTN)3N with (HIPTN)3N= hexaisopropyl-terphenyl-triamidoamine is the only compound performing this process catalytically. In this review we describe how Density Functional Theory calculations have been of help in elucidating the reaction mechanisms of the inorganic compounds that activate or fix N2. These studies provided important insights that rationalize and complement the experimental findings about the reaction mechanisms of known catalysts, predicting the reactivity of new potential catalysts and helping in tailoring new efficient catalytic compounds.},

The formation of H atoms (reduction product) and (•)OH radicals (oxidation product) from water, and CO(3)(-) radical anions (oxidation product) from carbonates, was detected in CO(2)-saturated titania aqueous dispersion under UV illumination. Additionally, methoxyl, (•)OCH(3), and methyl, (•)CH(3), radicals were identified as reaction intermediates. The two-electron, one-proton reaction proposed as an initial step in the reduction of CO(2) on the surface of TiO(2) is supported by the results of first-principles calculations.},

In this elegant assessment of the human condition in the third millennium, cognitive scientist and public intellectual Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophesies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data: In 75 jaw-dropping graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing.Far from being a na{\"\i}ve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human nature{\textemdash}tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinking{\textemdash}which demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation.With intellectual depth and literary flair, Pinker makes the case for reason, science, and humanism: the ideals we need to confront our problems and continue our progress.AVAILABLE AT:AmazonBarnes \&amp; NobleIndieBoundBooks-a-MillioniBooksREVIEWSFull ReviewsReview ExtractsInterviews \&amp; Articles },

abstract = {Research on zeolite-catalyzed methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) conversion has long been concerned with the mechanism of the reaction between methanol and alkenes. Two pathways have been debated: (1) the stepwise, proceeding through a surface-methoxy intermediate and (2) the concerted, in which the alkenes react directly with methanol. This work addresses the debate through micro-kinetic modeling based on density functional theory calculations of both pathways, as well as experiments employing temporal analysis of products to investigate the kinetics of the stepwise pathway for a series of alkenes in H-ZSM-22 zeolite. The model predicts the stepwise pathway to prevail at typical MTH reaction temperatures, due to a higher entropy loss in the concerted as compared to the stepwise pathway. The entropy difference results from intermediate release of water in the stepwise pathway. These findings lead us to suggest that the stepwise pathway should also be considered when modeling MTH conversion in other zeolites.}

  abstract={The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}

@article{Stohr1991,
abstract = {The catalytic activity of activated carbons in oxidation reactions with O2is enhanced after treatment with NH3or HCN at elevated temperatures (600-900°C). The oxidation of dilute aqueous H2SO3was measured as a test of catalytic activity. Nitrogen is chemisorbed in the treatment and XPS showed two N 1s signals with binding energies of 401-400 eV and 399-398 eV which are assigned to amine groups and nitrile and/or pyridine-like nitrogen, respectively. In the case of HCN treatment, the N content was higher on the surface than in the bulk and the accessible micropore volume was reduced. It could be reopened by heating in N2to 900°C. The catalytic activity was significantly increased after heating in H2or N2to 900°C although the N content was considerably reduced. The carbon is partly gasified in the reaction with NH3at 900°C leading to an increase of the pore volume in the micropore range. Thermodesorption experiments with H2O, adsorbed at 300 K and N2and O2adsorbed at ca. 80 K gave evidence of the presence of very narrow micropores of molecular dimensions in the NH3-activated carbon. With O2, a desorption peak for a reversibly chemisorbed O2species was observed at 190-210 K with measurable desorption extending to T {\textgreater} 300 K. This desorption peak was also observed with O2adsorbed on HOPG. XPS measurements at T {\textless} 170 K showed a signal at an O 1s b.e. of 533 eV which is assigned to O2-ions. The NH3-activated carbon catalyzed H2O formation from H2and O2at T {\textless} 170 K. Further chemical evidence for the presence of O2is described. In addition, it was found that also synthetic graphite of fine particle size catalyzed H2SO3oxidation. The catalytic activity seems to be enhanced by chemisorbed nitrogen atoms, but the concentration of the active species is below the limits of XPS detection. {\textcopyright} 1991.},
