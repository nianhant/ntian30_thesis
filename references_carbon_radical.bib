abstractNote = {TiO2 is quartz (alpha) structured and crystallizes in the trigonal P3_121 space group. The structure is three-dimensional. Ti4+ is bonded to four equivalent O2- atoms to form corner-sharing TiO4 tetrahedra. All Ti–O bond lengths are 1.83 Å. O2- is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent Ti4+ atoms.},
